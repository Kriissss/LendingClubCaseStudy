# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services

## Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from a consumer finance company. The goal is to identify patterns and variables that influence loan defaults, which can guide decision-making to minimize credit losses.

## Problem Statement

When a loan application is received, the company must decide whether to approve or reject it. Two key risks are associated with this decision:

Business Loss: Not approving a loan for applicants who are likely to repay.

Credit Loss: Approving loans for applicants who are likely to default.

The objective is to minimize credit losses by identifying risky applicants through data analysis.

## Objectives

Understand the factors that drive loan defaults.

Analyze consumer and loan attributes to determine their influence on default rates.

Provide actionable insights to assist in portfolio and risk management.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis followed these steps:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Univariate Analysis: Studied individual variables (distributions and trends).

Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between variables.

Insights and Recommendations: Derived actionable insights to minimize credit risk.
